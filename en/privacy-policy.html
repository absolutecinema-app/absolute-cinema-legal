<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>Last updated: 17 January 2026</p>
<div class="box">
<p>This is the Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) of TIMING CORPORATION (a French company registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number SIREN 991 278 284 and whose registered office is located at 24 rue du Cotentin, PARIS – 75015) (“TIMING CORPORATION” or “we”). The Policy describes how we collect and use information, including personal information about you (the “User” or “you”) when you play the ABSOLUTE CINEMA Game or other future games published by TIMING CORPORATION (each a “Game” and collectively the “Games”).</p>

<p>Our services may be accessible via a web browser, social networks (for example, Facebook) or as an application on various platforms (for example, the App Store, Google Play Store).</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact TIMING CORPORATION at the following email address: contact@absolute-cinema-app.com</p>
</div>

<p>When you play our Game, we will collect and store personal data about you which we will use for various purposes, as explained in this Policy. Most of this data is necessary to allow you to access and play our Games.</p>

<p>However, in some cases, we may ask you to provide us with other personal data or use your personal data for purposes that are not essential to the operation of the Game. In such a case, you are not required to provide us with such data and you have the right to refuse its use (if the same data is used for other purposes). For example, we may ask for your email address to recover your password. We will not use it for other purposes without informing you in advance and without giving you the opportunity to refuse or give your consent, depending on the case.</p>

<p>Our Game displays advertisements, and on many devices, the advertisements you see are personalized using a specific advertising identifier on your device. You can disable ad personalization for all of your apps and disable the advertising identifier in your device settings. However, you will continue to receive ads, but they will not be personalized. You will find more information on advertising and advertising identifiers in Sections 5 and 6.</p>

<p>You have the right to object to the use of your personal data and to exercise other rights to access and control its use. These rights include in particular:</p>

<p>Request access to the personal data we hold about you;</p>
<p>Request that we correct inaccurate data about you;</p>
<p>Request that we delete personal data about you;</p>
<p>The right to lodge a complaint with the competent authorities if you believe we do not comply with applicable data protection regulations;</p>

<p>Your rights and how to exercise them are detailed in Section 4.</p>

<p>Please note that if you delete our Game from your device, we will not be notified and your personal data will remain stored with us. If you wish to access your data or request its deletion, please follow the instructions in Section 4.</p>

<h2>Personal data collected when using our ABSOLUTE CINEMA Game</h2>

<p>Below are some examples of the personal data we collect when you use our Application:</p>

<p>1. Device-related data (such as your IP address, device identifier and advertising identifier). This data is used in particular to provide you with access to our Game. As our Game contains advertisements, we may also use this data to provide you with better targeted or more relevant ads (unless you have disabled ad personalization in your device settings).</p>

<p>2. Login and contact details (your username, password, bio and email). In our Game, you may provide a username and a password. If you play our Game, we will store this information. The purpose is to allow you to log in to your account on multiple devices and to recover your password if you forget it.</p>

<p>We will also ask you for a bio (short biography), which is not mandatory, in order to complete your account. This bio may include, for example, your three favorite films.</p>

<p>3. History of your purchases made in the Game. When you make a purchase in our Game, we keep a record of such purchase in order to comply with regulatory obligations and to assist customer support in the event of an issue with your transaction.</p>

<p>4. Gameplay history. When you play our Game, we record information about your activity, such as your interactions or how long you played our Game (or the mini-games within the Application). This information is used to analyze the Game’s operation and helps us improve the Game.</p>

<p>5. Profile picture. In our Game, you may personalize your in-game avatar using your own profile picture, which could be a photo of you. In some cases, this means we will store your profile picture on our servers. Please refer to our General Terms of Use for more information.</p>

<p>6. Social network information. If you connect to our Game via a social network and your privacy settings allow it, TIMING CORPORATION may access certain information about you through that social network. If you do not want us to collect such information, do not connect to our Game via your social network.</p>

<p>7. Other information provided to customer support (information you choose to provide when you contact us for technical support or other assistance).</p>

<p>8. Geographical location. Using your IP address, we will determine your geographical location at the country and city level. It may be used in our Game to provide you with a localized gaming experience.</p>

<h2>Transfers of data outside the European Union</h2>

<p>Your personal data may be transferred to companies located outside the European Union with which we may need to work to provide our services. The laws applicable in those countries may not ensure the same level of personal data protection as in your country of residence.</p>

<p>You will find more details on how we use your personal data in the following sections of this Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Who this Policy applies to</h2>

<p>This Policy applies to anyone using our Game or otherwise contacting us, for example by email.</p>

<h2>2. When this Policy applies</h2>

<p>This Policy applies to the processing of personal data by TIMING CORPORATION.</p>

<p>The term “personal data” means any information enabling the identification of a living person, alone or combined with other information, as well as any other data qualified as personal in accordance with the legislation applicable to TIMING CORPORATION, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<h2>3. Legal bases we rely on when processing your personal data</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION may only use personal data if there is a legally valid reason to justify the relevant use. TIMING CORPORATION relies on the following legal bases:</p>

<p>Performance of a contract: We rely on this legal basis when the processing of personal data is necessary to provide a Game, product or service requested by the User. This includes allowing the User to log in to their account, play our Game, improve the User’s experience while playing, which may include adjusting the Game’s difficulty based on your progress, enabling you to play against other Users or play in a team, approving your transactions so you can make purchases within the Game, and providing TIMING CORPORATION customer support.</p>

<p>Legitimate interest: Certain uses of personal data are based on what TIMING CORPORATION considers to be its legitimate interest in using personal data. We rely on this legal basis, for example, to improve our Game, to provide you with personalized advertisements and to prevent fraud or other illegal activity. For TIMING CORPORATION to rely on this legal basis, the legitimate interest must not override the Users’ fundamental rights, freedoms and interests. You have the right to object to this processing. You can contact us at any time to request more information on how we concluded that our use of personal data based on legitimate interest is not overridden by your interests.</p>

<p>Legal obligation: We rely on this legal basis when we must process personal data to comply with a legal obligation applicable to TIMING CORPORATION. For example, financial information that must be stored for accounting and tax reporting purposes.</p>

<p>Consent: If we ask for your consent for certain types of processing and you agree, we will use your personal data for the processing you consented to. For example, if we asked to use your email address for purposes requiring your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time and we will then stop any future processing based on it.</p>

<h2>4. What are your rights?</h2>

<p>Right to object</p>

<p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data that we base on our legitimate interest, for reasons relating to your personal situation. If you object and the processing is based on legitimate interest, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing which override your privacy interests.</p>

<p>You may also object at any time to our sending you direct marketing content or using personal data to define a marketing target (profiling for direct marketing), and we will then stop such use.</p>

<p>You may also opt out of personalized advertising based on your profile. To learn more, see Sections 5 and 6.</p>

<p>However, please note that even if you object to certain processing, TIMING CORPORATION may continue such processing if it is based on another legal basis. For example, to provide you with the Game (if you still wish to use it) or to comply with legal obligations.</p>

<p>Right to restrict</p>

<p>You may request that the use of certain of your personal data be restricted, for example if the personal data is inaccurate, if you consider that TIMING CORPORATION no longer needs the personal data for the purposes described in this Policy, or if you have objected to the use of your personal data based on legitimate interest.</p>

<p>Right to access and rectification</p>

<p>Upon request, we will provide you with more detailed information on how we use your personal data. You have the right to receive information such as which of your personal data TIMING CORPORATION processes, where we collected the data, for what reasons the data was used, and the identity of the third parties to whom the data was provided.</p>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION may require reasonable administrative fees for repeated requests. If a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular due to its repetitive nature, TIMING CORPORATION may also refuse to act on the request. We may also ask you to specify the information you wish to access.</p>

<p>You also have the right, at any time, to request the correction of any inaccurate or incomplete personal data.</p>

<p>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)</p>

<p>You may request that we erase your personal data, for example if you have deleted your account and the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, if you withdraw your consent and there is no other legal basis for processing the data, or if you object to our use of your data based on legitimate interest. Your personal data may also be erased in other circumstances.</p>

<p>Right to withdraw consent</p>

<p>If you have given your consent to TIMING CORPORATION for the processing of your personal data, you may always withdraw such consent to prevent any future processing based on that consent.</p>

<p>Right to data portability</p>

<p>You have the right to receive personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us and which we use on the basis of your consent or to perform a contract with you, in a commonly used and readable format, and to have this information transmitted to another platform where technically feasible.</p>

<p>Accessing your data or Request to be forgotten</p>

<p>If you want to access your data or want us to erase it, please send us an email at: contact@absolute-cinema-app.com.</p>

<p>When you request access to your information, you will receive the personal information we hold about you in our Game.</p>

<p>When you request to be forgotten, we will delete any personal information we have about you from our Game. This means you will lose your progress and purchases made in our Game and we will not be able to restore anything.</p>

<h2>5. Advertising</h2>

<p>Our Game displays advertisements. These may be banners, full-screen ads or short videos. In our Game, you may, via an in-app purchase, prevent advertisements from being displayed. In addition, you may sometimes have the opportunity to earn something (for example, virtual currency) by watching a short advertising video.</p>

<p>The advertisements you see are provided by third parties.</p>

<p>For example: we may use Google’s AdMob to display advertisements in our Application. AdMob may collect information about your device, such as the device identifier, geolocation data (if enabled), and your interactions with ads. This information is used to serve personalized ads and analyze ad performance. To learn more about how Google collects and uses this information, please refer to their privacy policy.</p>

<p>You can manage your advertising preferences in the Application settings.</p>

<h2>6. Advertising identifiers</h2>

<p>Advertising identifiers are identifiers that devices, such as mobile phones, provide to identify that device to advertising partners. This identifier is used by advertisers to serve more relevant personalized advertisements in applications and Games.</p>

<p>You can opt out of personalized advertising on your device by disabling your device’s advertising identifier. The exact procedure depends on the device you use, but generally you can change this setting in the privacy section of your device preferences. Please note that you will still see advertisements if you disable the advertising identifier, but they will not be based on your profile and will likely be less relevant to you.</p>

<h2>7. How long will personal data be stored?</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION will store and use your personal data for as long as you have an account with us and for as long as we consider it necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy. This means we will use different categories of data over different periods.</p>

<p>For example, we will use contact and login information, gameplay history and device-related data for as long as you play our Game and for as long as we need to provide you with your account in future Games. We will also use your payment information for longer periods to comply with legal obligations such as accounting and financial reporting. You may contact us at any time for more information on the retention period for the various categories of personal data.</p>

<h2>8. With whom is personal data shared?</h2>

<p>Companies within the TIMING CORPORATION group</p>

<p>Your personal data may be provided to other (future) companies within the TIMING CORPORATION group in order to provide you with the Games and for the group’s internal administrative needs.</p>

<p>Companies engaged by TIMING CORPORATION</p>

<p>Your personal data may be transferred to and processed by third-party service providers and vendors that may perform services for TIMING CORPORATION (data processors). These companies may be located both inside and outside the European Union.</p>

<p>All third-party service providers and vendors must follow TIMING CORPORATION’s applicable written data processing instructions and agreements and all other agreements in place between TIMING CORPORATION and such providers and vendors, and must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.</p>

<p>Third parties may be grouped into:</p>

<p>Core infrastructure: Our server infrastructure is hosted by Google Cloud Services and, for certain parts, by Amazon AWS. Your personal data will be stored with these parties either within the European Union or in the United States.</p>

<p>Marketing: We may use other companies for our marketing activities. Therefore, if you see an advertisement for our Game, our marketing partners may see certain information such as your IP address or your advertising identifier.</p>

<p>Advertising: In our Game, we serve advertisements. These advertisements are provided by our advertising partners. When you view or interact with an advertisement, certain data, such as an IP address or an advertising identifier, will be visible to them.</p>

<p>Authorities: TIMING CORPORATION may have to provide personal data to competent authorities (for example: tax authorities or the police) in accordance with applicable law and in order to comply with any legal obligation in each jurisdiction where TIMING CORPORATION operates, to the extent permitted by applicable data protection law. In the event of a data leak/breach, certain personal data may have to be provided to the competent data protection authorities.</p>

<h2>9. Links to third-party websites and third-party advertisements</h2>

<p>Advertisements appearing in the Game present not only TIMING CORPORATION’s products and services, but also products and services of third-party companies. TIMING CORPORATION is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites or applications, even if you access them via links in the Game, in-Game advertisements or advertisements on a web page when you play the Game. TIMING CORPORATION recommends that you review the policy of each site you visit and contact its owner or operator with any questions.</p>

<p>In addition, if you access the Game from a third-party site or via a social network (e.g., Facebook…), TIMING CORPORATION is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of such third-party sites, and recommends that you consult that third party’s policy and contact its owner or operator if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>10. To which countries will my personal data be transferred?</h2>

<p>Your personal data may be transferred to companies in other countries, both within and outside the European Union, which we have engaged, among other things, to provide you with a Game and allow you to play our Game.</p>

<p>Countries outside the EU may not ensure the same level of personal data protection as in your country. In such cases, TIMING CORPORATION will use best efforts to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected by the third parties receiving it in those countries. Adequate protection may typically consist of imposing contractual obligations on the recipient party in accordance with the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, ensuring that such party maintains the same high level of confidentiality and security of data as that applied by TIMING CORPORATION.</p>

<h2>11. Security</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION has implemented technology and policies to protect your privacy and personal data against unauthorized access and misuse. We do not aim to collect information about you in order to identify you directly, such as your name or address, but we collect information that may identify you indirectly, such as your device identifier.</p>

<p>However, you may also occasionally provide your email address, but you are not required to provide it if you do not wish to.</p>

<h2>12. Children</h2>

<p>You must be above a certain age to play our Game or use our services. The minimum age varies depending on your country of origin. To our knowledge, we do not collect information, do not request personal information and do not serve personalized advertisements to anyone below the minimum age requirements.</p>

<p>If you believe we may have information about a user who has not yet reached the required age, please contact us.</p>

<p>Examples of minimum age:</p>

<p>16 years: France, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Slovakia</p>

<p>15 years: Finland</p>
