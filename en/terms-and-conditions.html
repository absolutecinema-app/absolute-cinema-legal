<h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE (TCS)</h1>

<div class="meta">
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 17 January 2026</p>
<p><strong>Publisher:</strong> TIMING CORPORATION, a French company registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number SIREN 991 278 284, with its registered office located at 24 rue du Cotentin, PARIS – 75015 (France).</p>
</div>

<div class="section-intro">
<p>These Terms and Conditions of Sale govern the purchase of virtual items, virtual currency and a Premium subscription within the ABSOLUTE CINEMA application (the “Application”).</p>
<p>They apply in addition to the General Terms of Use.</p>
</div>

<h2>SUBSCRIPTION AND VIRTUAL ITEMS</h2>

<h2>1. Subscription model</h2>

<p>The Application offers a Premium version accessible through a monthly or annual subscription. This optional subscription provides additional benefits but is not required to access the base game. By subscribing, you agree to pay the monthly or annual fees (depending on the subscription you choose) applicable to these additional features and benefits.</p>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION reserves the right to suspend or terminate your subscription or your access to the Service in the event of a breach of the Terms of Use, abusive behavior, or any action disrupting the proper operation of the Service. In such a case, TIMING CORPORATION is not required to refund the remaining subscription period or the portion of the Service already used.</p>

<p>The Premium service provides access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>no interstitial advertisements;</li>
<li>exclusive bonuses;</li>
<li>Premium features;</li>
<li>special rewards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Payment and renewal</h2>

<p>Subscription payments are processed through the relevant payment platform, such as Apple, Google, or any other third-party service. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel it before the renewal date.</p>

<p>To avoid renewal: the User must cancel at least 48 hours before the renewal date from the “Subscriptions” page of the App Store or Google Play Store.</p>

<p>Subscription or purchase fees are charged to your Google Play account (Android) or Apple ID (iPhone).</p>

<p>You authorize TIMING CORPORATION to charge your payment method for the subscription amount unless you cancel in accordance with the cancellation policy.</p>

<h2>3. Cancellation and refunds</h2>

<p>You may cancel your Premium subscription at any time in your account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period and you retain access to the Service until that date. TIMING CORPORATION grants no refunds or credits for partial subscription periods, unless required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>4. Changes to subscription fees</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION reserves the right to change subscription prices at any time. Price changes will take effect at the beginning of the next billing cycle after prior notice to the affected users.</p>

<h2>5. Payment methods</h2>

<p>Accepted payment methods are determined by the provider of the relevant platform (e.g., App Store, Google Play Store or other payment service providers). It is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date.</p>

<h2>6. Virtual items</h2>

<p>Virtual Items may be “purchased” or “earned” in our Game. There are two types of Virtual Items available:</p>

<ul>
<li>a. “virtual currency”, a currency that cannot be physically held. For example, tokens, tickets, coins, bills, points, bonuses or any other form of virtual currency that can be used in our Game to purchase “virtual goods” and/or to access the mini-games of our Application;</li>
<li>b. “virtual goods”, a virtual object that you can use to enhance your gameplay experience, for example by granting you access to certain aspects of the game (in-game status upgrade, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Purchase and possession of Virtual Items</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION allows you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>a. purchase Virtual Items in a Game with real money;</li>
<li>b. earn Virtual Items as part of promotional offers, contests or events set up by TIMING CORPORATION or a third party;</li>
<li>c. earn Virtual Items by playing the Game itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. License for Virtual Items</h2>

<p>Your use of Virtual Items is subject to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>a. Virtual Items cannot be exchanged or refunded. Once a Virtual Item is purchased, you cannot recover the real money spent since Virtual Items have no real monetary value. The virtual currency balance visible on your Platform account is not a real financial balance and reflects no monetary value; it represents only the limits of your license to use Virtual Items in a Game;</li>
<li>b. Virtual Items are personal and non-transferable. This means that you may only use your own Virtual Items and you may not allow anyone else to use them through your Account or Platform account, or otherwise. You may not trade your Virtual Items in any way. You may not sell them for real money to other players, exchange them for other objects, or divert their use (except for in-game virtual auctions that the publisher may organize);</li>
<li>c. your right to use Virtual Items is revoked if the Platform provider has to suspend or delete your Platform account pursuant to these Conditions;</li>
<li>d. your right to use Virtual Items will expire five (5) years after purchase. In accordance with applicable laws, or at its sole discretion, TIMING CORPORATION may refund unused virtual currencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Prices</h2>

<p>The price you must pay for the Virtual Items (the “Price”) is indicated in the Game at the time you make your purchase.</p>

<p>Prices:</p>

<ul>
<li>are set by the Publisher;</li>
<li>are displayed in the local currency;</li>
<li>may vary depending on the platform (Apple/Google, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you reside in the European Union, the User receives:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Price inclusive of all taxes;</li>
<li>the nature of the Premium content;</li>
<li>the payment frequency;</li>
<li>the identity of the seller;</li>
<li>the minimum commitment period (monthly or annual).</li>
</ul>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION reserves the right to change the Price and the characteristics of the Virtual Items without providing justification. Any price change applies only to future purchases.</p>

<h2>10. Errors</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION uses its best efforts to ensure that no errors are made in the Game, particularly regarding the price, the conditions of your purchases and the use of Virtual Items in the Game. However:</p>

<ul>
<li>a. The Publisher reserves the right to declare any obvious error null and void, regardless of its nature or consequences, including human or technical errors. For example, an incorrect valuation of virtual currency that would have allowed you to benefit from a discount or an incorrect allocation of items. Any Virtual Item acquired by taking advantage of such errors will be removed;</li>
<li>b. if the value displayed in a Game was incorrect at the time you purchased such Virtual Items and you contact TIMING CORPORATION about this, we will: (i) communicate the correct Price or value; and (ii) ask you to confirm whether or not you wish to proceed with the purchase of the Virtual Item now that you know its price. In the case of a limited-time offer, TIMING CORPORATION will indicate the validity period of the offer or the Price. If you choose not to confirm your purchase, TIMING CORPORATION will refund the amount already paid.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. Availability of Virtual Items</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION reserves the right to limit the number of Virtual Items you may purchase during a given time period. Virtual Items may only be purchased and used by players whose jurisdiction allows them to do so. Virtual Items may only be purchased from TIMING CORPORATION through the Game or otherwise if authorization has been given. The Publisher reserves the right to refuse the purchase of a Virtual Item for any reason.</p>

<h2>12. Delivery and immediate performance</h2>

<p>Digital products (Virtual Items, virtual currency, Premium) are provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>immediately after purchase;</li>
<li>or within a few minutes (technical processing time).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of a delay, the User may contact customer service at: contact@absolute-cinema-app.com</p>

<h2>13. Refunds</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION may cancel a payment and refund you, including any transaction fees incurred with payment service providers, if it has reasons to believe: (a) the purchase is incomplete; or (b) the purchase is made, or TIMING CORPORATION suspects it is made, fraudulently or otherwise in bad faith.</p>

<p>A refund may also be granted exceptionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the event of double payment;</li>
<li>at the Publisher’s sole discretion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>14. Suspension of a purchase or removal of items</h2>

<p>The Publisher may remove or suspend a Virtual Item:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the event of fraud;</li>
<li>if a purchase is canceled by Apple/Google;</li>
<li>in the event of abusive use;</li>
<li>in the event of a proven technical error.</li>
</ul>

<p>No compensation shall be due.</p>

<h2>15. Waiver of the right of withdrawal — Digital content</h2>

<p>When you purchase Virtual Items, you acknowledge that you do not have the right of withdrawal once the download of such Virtual Items has been completed, due to the nature of these goods.</p>

<h2>16. Payment methods</h2>

<p>The payment methods accepted by the Publisher are those offered by the relevant Platform provider, such as Apple, Google, Facebook or others within a Game.</p>

<h2>17. Payment security</h2>
