<h2>1. Purpose of these Terms</h2>

<p>These General Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms”) are intended to define the conditions for accessing and using the ABSOLUTE CINEMA application (the “Application” or “Game”), operated by TIMING CORPORATION (the “Publisher” or “we”).</p>

<p>You may use the Application via a web browser, a social network (e.g., Facebook) or through applications (e.g., the App Store, Google Play Store) (each a “Platform”, and collectively the “Platforms”).</p>

<p>By installing, accessing or using the Application, you (the “User” or “you”) acknowledge that you have read these Terms and accept them without reservation.</p>

<p>If you do not accept these Terms, you must stop using the Application.</p>

<p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement and you must read them carefully. By installing, using our Application or otherwise accessing it, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms. If you do not accept any of these Terms, you may not install, use or access our Application.</p>

<p>The Publisher may suspend or delete/terminate the User’s account in the event of fraud or breach of these Terms.</p>

<h2>2. Description of the Application</h2>

<p>ABSOLUTE CINEMA is a mobile entertainment application offering several mini-games about cinema and series, available in solo mode or online multiplayer mode, as well as:</p>

<ul>
<li>leaderboards, a player profile, a points system and rewards;</li>
<li>an in-app shop enabling the purchase of content, virtual benefits, virtual items, or a monthly or annual subscription;</li>
<li>the display and distribution of advertisements;</li>
<li>a guest mode with no mandatory account creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Publisher may add, modify or remove games at any time.</p>

<p>The Publisher may also freely modify, add or remove features without prior notice, provided that this does not affect the consumer’s essential rights under applicable laws.</p>

<h2>3. Use of the Application</h2>

<h3>3.1 When may you use our Application</h3>

<p>In order to obtain the right to play our Application and purchase virtual items (“Virtual Items”), you must represent that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you own the device you use to access and play our Application and, if you purchase Virtual Items, that you are authorized to make such a purchase using the payment methods offered in our Application;</li>
<li>you do not live in a country: (i) under embargo by the U.S. government or designated by the U.S. government as an ally of terrorism; and (ii) you are not on any list of prohibited or restricted persons or entities maintained by the U.S. government;</li>
<li>the information you have provided to us is accurate and you undertake to update it if necessary;</li>
<li>you have not been banned or blocked from our Application or any Platform;</li>
<li>if you have downloaded our Application from a Platform, you must have a valid account on that Platform;</li>
</ul>

<p>you must not:</p>

<ul>
<li>a. copy, rent, sub-rent, grant a license right, lend, sell, trade or otherwise exploit the Application or any Virtual Items of the Application;</li>
<li>b. use the Application or the Application’s Virtual Items for illegal activities or in any other manner prohibited by these Terms;</li>
<li>c. use the Application or the Application’s Virtual Items to distribute obscene, violent, threatening, slanderous, discriminatory or otherwise offensive content in TIMING CORPORATION’s opinion;</li>

</ul>

<p>You must be a certain age to play our Application and access our services. This age varies depending on your country of origin.</p>

<h3>3.2 Acceptance of the Terms</h3>

<p>If you have an account on a Platform and download ABSOLUTE CINEMA from that Platform, or if you participate in our Game via a browser, a website or any other platform, you are deemed to accept these Terms of Use. If you do not accept these Terms, do not download, play or participate in our Application, as doing so is prohibited without having accepted the Terms.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that these Terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>apply from the moment you download our Application;</li>
<li>apply to our Application and all virtual elements;</li>
<li>create a legally binding contract between you and TIMING CORPORATION, and not with the Platform provider. The Publisher is fully responsible to you for its Application and its content, unlike the Platform provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Publisher may amend these Terms at any time without prior notice. If you do not agree with the changes made to these Terms, you must stop using the Game. If you continue to play, you implicitly accept the amended Terms.</p>

<h3>3.3 Specific terms</h3>

If there is a conflict between our Terms and the Platform Terms, the Platform Terms prevail if the conflict relates to use of the Platform.</p>

<p>In addition to the Platform Terms, additional specific terms may also apply to our Application depending on how you access it. We or one of our business partners or a third party may occasionally organize a contest or promotion subject to additional terms. These are the “Specific Terms”. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Specific Terms, the latter shall prevail.</p>

<h3>Third-party links</h3>

<p>Certain links, including hyperlinks, present on ABSOLUTE CINEMA and on any social network platform you use, may cause you to leave the Game and the social platforms from which the Game is accessible and may redirect you to external websites not belonging to the Game or the Platform. This does not mean that TIMING CORPORATION has approved the linked site, its operator or its content. You acknowledge that TIMING CORPORATION has no control over the content of such external websites and does not guarantee their accuracy, integrity or quality. Such sites may be governed by their own terms, privacy policies and cookie policies and it is your responsibility to inform yourself about them.</p>

<h2>EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h2>

<h2>11. What is neither excluded nor limited</h2>

<p>None of the exclusions or limitations set out in these Terms shall exclude or limit TIMING CORPORATION’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. These Terms do not affect your statutory rights as a consumer.</p>

<h2>12. Implied terms</h2>

<p>The express provisions of these Terms replace and expressly exclude all warranties, conditions, terms, undertakings and obligations which, but for these Terms, would be implied or incorporated by any collateral contract, statute, common law, case law, custom, trade usage or otherwise. All such implied terms are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>13. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>

<p>The Publisher provides the Game “as is” and endeavors to ensure continuous access to the Application but does not guarantee:</p>

<ul>
<li>the absence of errors;</li>
<li>permanent availability;</li>
<li>uninterrupted operation;</li>
<li>compatibility with any device or configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Application is available online 24/7. However, the Publisher cannot guarantee that access to the Game will be uninterrupted, reliable or error-free, in particular given the complexity of the internet network and peak user traffic at certain times. The Publisher provides no guarantee of continuity or quality of service and shall not be liable in the event of temporary inability to access all or part of the Application. No right to compensation shall arise under this paragraph.</p>

<p>As the Application is constantly evolving, errors may occur in its operation. The Publisher undertakes to correct them as quickly as possible when they arise.</p>

<p>The Publisher cannot guarantee that the Game will be accurate, complete or reliable. Although the Publisher uses its best efforts to make the Game available 24 hours a day, TIMING CORPORATION shall not be liable if, for any reason, the Game is unavailable at any time or for any period. Access to the Game may be temporarily suspended without notice in the event of system failure, maintenance or repair, or for reasons beyond the Publisher’s control. The Publisher may also need to change or maintain the Game at any time. If necessary, the Publisher may suspend access to the Game or any part of the Game or close it permanently. As the Publisher is subject to an obligation of means, it cannot be held liable for occasional operational issues with the application.</p>

<p>If the Game was downloaded from a Platform, you and TIMING CORPORATION acknowledge that the Platform provider has no obligation to provide maintenance or support services for our Game. You acknowledge that TIMING CORPORATION, and not the Platform provider, is responsible for handling claims relating to its products, failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, or claims relating to consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>

<p>The Publisher reserves the right to modify, extend, delete or limit certain features of the Application at any time, without prior notice and without incurring liability. The Publisher will nevertheless use its best efforts to inform users of changes to the application via the Application’s internal communication system.</p>

<h2>14. Limitation and exclusion of liability</h2>

<ul>
<li>the Application is provided “as is”;</li>

<li>the Publisher is not liable for loss or damage resulting from the use of content posted by users.</li>

<li>a. liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, and whether due to negligence or not) that TIMING CORPORATION may have to you arising from: (i) inaccuracies, technical, factual, textual or typographical errors or omissions (human or computer) concerning the Game or any information provided in connection with it; (ii) unavailability of the Game (or any part of the Game); or (iii) any misrepresentation concerning the Game;</li>

<li>c. liability for any loss or damage you may suffer if someone else used your identity, login details, password or account, with or without your knowledge/consent, including in the event of theft of the device used to activate your account;</li>
<li>d. in the event of loss or damage to content (including data), your sole remedy shall be that the Publisher uses its best efforts to restore lost or damaged data or content from the last backup performed by TIMING CORPORATION. However, TIMING CORPORATION shall not be liable for any loss of data or content occurring before a backup or restoration can be performed;</li>
<li>e. TIMING CORPORATION disclaims any liability for third-party services, content or websites accessible from or to ABSOLUTE CINEMA. Use of such links is at your own risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>16. Reasonableness</h2>

<p>You agree that each of these exclusions, limitations and disclaimers is reasonable having regard to the nature of the Game. Each of the exclusions, limitations and disclaimers above shall be interpreted as a separate and severable provision of our contract with you.</p>

<h2>GENERAL</h2>

<h2>17. Suspension and/or termination of your account</h2>

<p>The Publisher may, in its sole discretion and at any time with immediate effect and for any reason (including breach of these Terms or the Code of Conduct, fraud, circumvention of systems, harmful or dangerous behavior, etc.):</p>

<ul>
<li>a. terminate or suspend your access to the Game (in which case we may share your name and email address and notify third parties, including Platform providers); or</li>
<li>b. verify your information by requesting certain documents and refuse your requests for access to the Game if we deem it necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>18. Assignment of rights and obligations</h2>

<p>TIMING CORPORATION may assign its rights and/or transfer its obligations under these Terms to any third party, including by sublicensing and/or subcontracting its rights and obligations under these Terms to a third party.</p>

<h2>19. Severability</h2>

<p>If any provision of these Terms is held, in whole or in part, to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court or competent administrative body under any law or regulation, such provision or part thereof shall be severed from these Terms. The validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h2>20. Entire agreement</h2>

<p>These Terms apply between TIMING CORPORATION and the User with respect to the matters described in this document, to the exclusion of any other terms (including any terms that you purport to apply) other than the Specific Terms described in Section 3.3. You may not rely on any agreement, understanding or arrangement that is not expressly set out in these Terms.</p>

<h2>21. Third parties</h2>

<p>You and TIMING CORPORATION acknowledge that if the Game has been purchased/downloaded via a Platform, such as the Apple Store or Google Play Store, this Platform provider and its affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce these Terms against you to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<h2>22. Intellectual property</h2>

<p>All elements of the Application (software, graphics, texts, databases, software code copyright, audiovisual effects, etc.) are protected by intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>Any unauthorized reproduction or extraction is prohibited.</p>

<h2>23. Personal data</h2>

<p>Data processing is described in the Privacy Policy, incorporated by reference into these Terms.</p>

<p>The Publisher is not responsible for the content or policies of such sites.</p>

<h2>25. Changes to the Terms</h2>

<p>The Publisher may amend these Terms.</p>

<p>Any material change will be notified within the Application.</p>

<p>Continued use of the Application after modification constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

<h2>26. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>

<p>These General Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with French law, unless the law of another country applies due to mandatory provisions on consumer protection. Any dispute arising from or in connection with these Terms shall be submitted to the jurisdiction of the French courts, with the Paris Judicial Court (Tribunal Judiciaire de Paris) having jurisdiction at first instance. However, the consumer may also bring the matter before the court of their place of residence. In the event of a dispute, you also have the option of contacting the National Consumer Protection Commission (CNPC).</p>

<h2>27. Complaints</h2>

<p>Please contact us immediately (our contact details are in Section 28 below) if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) have questions, complaints, claims or concerns regarding content appearing in our Game, in relation to our Virtual Items/rewards, or in relation to the Publisher in general;</li>
<li>(b) believe that any act or omission by the Publisher or by one of our players violates applicable law.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Publisher will then review your concerns and decide what action to take, based on TIMING CORPORATION’s opinion as to whether another player has breached these Terms. TIMING CORPORATION will endeavor to inform you of the outcome of any review within a reasonable time after receiving your complaint. TIMING CORPORATION and the User both acknowledge that Platform providers have no obligation to investigate, settle, defend or resolve any dispute relating to the intellectual property of the Game. The right to complain about a defect in the Game or the Game’s Virtual Items/rewards is revoked after three years.</p>
